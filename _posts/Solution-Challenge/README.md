### What's the problem?

&nbsp; Low vision students in South Korean universities are facing issues with their learning rights, as they are unable to engage in independent learning. Over 90% of visually impaired individuals in South Korea are low vision individuals, making this issue prevalent not only in universities but among visually impaired individuals in general. Professors typically provide lecture notes in PDF format, requiring low vision students to use the built-in screen reader function on their devices to learn through voice. However, we found that no document reader applications are low vision-friendly and specifically designed for these students. Also, there was a large difference in the range that can be read between phone/tablet models, and operating systems

&nbsp; As per the Disability Discrimination Act, volunteer learning assistants are recruited to guarantee the learning rights of individuals with disabilities. However, low vision students still require more time to learn than general students, and their learning period is delayed as they need to wait 1-2 weeks to receive transcriptions of lecture notes from volunteers. Moreover, most universities lack volunteers to support students with disabilities.

&nbsp; We are dedicated to improving the educational experience of low vision college students. Through studying low vision YouTubers, we gained insight into their learning methods and difficulties. Remote learning during the pandemic worsened the challenges faced by visually impaired students, and even with in-person classes resuming, feedback indicates that low vision students still struggle. Our mission is to ensure their right to education by providing a service that empowers them to learn independently within the university.
